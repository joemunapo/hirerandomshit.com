# RFC 0001 – MVP Definition

## 📝 Problem
Zimbabwe’s informal hiring and rentals are messy and unstructured — mostly happening through WhatsApp groups or word-of-mouth.  
There is no **trusted, centralized platform** where people can list, hire, and pay for small gigs, tools, or services.  

---

## 💡 Solution (MVP Features)
A **web-first platform** (Laravel + Filament) inspired by Gumroad’s simplicity, where people can:  
- Create and browse **listings** (tools, services, gigs).  
- **Book and pay** with escrow (funds held → released on completion, or refunded).  
- Leave **ratings & reviews** to build trust.  
- Use a **clean, Gumroad-like interface** that feels modern and simple.  
- Have an **admin back office (Filament)** to manage disputes, listings, and payouts.  
- Provide **diaspora checkout** so people outside Zimbabwe can pay for services for family/friends locally.  

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- 200+ listings in Mutare within 3 months  
- 50+ completed hires using escrow  
- Positive feedback: NPS ≥ 40 from both hirers and providers  

---

## 🔐 Trust & Safety
- **Escrow payments**: EcoCash, InnBucks, USD cash-in/out  
- **KYC-lite verification**: verified phone/email for listers  
- **Dispute handling**: simple admin mediation (refund, release, or split payments)  

---

## ⚠️ Risks
- Payment rail reliability (EcoCash/InnBucks downtime).  
- Manual cash handling for USD (needs trusted agents).  
- Ensuring fair disputes without overloading admin team.  
- Balancing edgy domain branding (“shit”) with professional UX.  

---

## 🚫 Not in MVP
- WhatsApp bot integration (web-first only).  
- Native Android/iOS apps.  
- Advanced pricing models (hourly, deposits).  
- Automated arbitration systems.
