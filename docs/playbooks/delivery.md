# Delivery Playbook (v0)

## Overview
HireRandomShit.com requires **simple, trusted delivery flows** for gigs and rentals.  
This playbook defines **how jobs and items are confirmed, completed, and released in escrow**.

---

## 📦 Standard Flow
1. **Booking created** → Escrow funded (EcoCash, InnBucks, USD cash-in).  
2. **Provider accepts** → Listing marked “in progress.”  
3. **Completion proof** required before funds released:  
   - Service: text confirmation + optional photo proof.  
   - Rental item: return confirmation + optional photo proof.  
4. **Escrow release** → Full, partial, or refund depending on outcome.  

---

## 🔐 Trust Elements
- Escrow is always required (no direct pay outside system).  
- Jobs can’t be closed without **completion proof**.  
- Admin can mediate disputes in Filament: release, refund, or split.  

---

## ⚠️ Cash Handling
- USD cash hires require an **agent handover code**.  
- Agents deposit/withdraw cash on behalf of platform.  
- Admin verifies evidence before authorizing release.  

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope (MVP)
- Automatic geo-tracking of deliveries.  
- Complex logistics integrations.
