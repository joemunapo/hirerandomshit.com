# RFC 0001 – MVP Definition

---

## 📝 Problem
Zimbabwe’s informal economy runs on hustles, word of mouth, and WhatsApp groups.  
There’s no **structured, trusted, and simple platform** to hire or rent services and items with accountability.  
As a result, transactions lack trust, dispute resolution, and consistent quality.

---

## 💡 Solution (MVP Features)
A **web-first, Gumroad-inspired marketplace** built on Laravel + Filament that enables users to safely list, hire, and pay for random services or items.  

### Core Features
- **Listings**  
  - Users can create listings for services or rentals (e.g., DJ, drill, tent, tutor).  
  - Categories: Tools, Services, Events, Miscellaneous.  

- **Bookings & Escrow**  
  - Hirer books a listing and pays into escrow (EcoCash, InnBucks, or USD cash).  
  - Provider accepts → listing marked *In Progress*.  
  - On completion, funds are released or refunded if disputed.  

- **Trust Layer**  
  - Phone/email verification (KYC-lite).  
  - Ratings & reviews per completed booking.  

- **UI/UX**  
  - Simple, clean Gumroad-style web interface.  
  - Landing page for early signups + waitlist.  
  - Mobile-responsive but no native apps.  

- **Admin (Filament)**  
  - Manage users, listings, disputes, and payouts.  
  - Escrow release/refund tools.  

- **Evidence & Disputes**  
  - Completion proof: photo upload or code confirmation.  
  - Admin mediates disputes manually in Filament.

## 🚫 Out of Scope (MVP)
- WhatsApp bot integration  
- Native iOS/Android apps  
- Automated arbitration or AI-driven dispute resolution  
- Complex delivery/logistics integrations  
- Advanced pricing models (hourly, deposits, bundles)  

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- **200+ listings** in Mutare within 90 days  
- **50+ completed hires** through escrow  
- **NPS ≥ 40** from both hirers and providers  

---

## ⚠️ Risks
- Payment rail downtime (EcoCash, InnBucks outages).  
- Manual workload on admins for disputes.  
- Cash-in/out reliability (agent trust).  
- Perception of edgy branding ("shit") affecting ad approval.
