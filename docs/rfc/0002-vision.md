## 1. 90-Day MVP (Mutare-first)

### 📌 Core Focus
Deliver a **web-first, Gumroad-inspired platform** that allows people in Mutare to safely hire or rent tools, services, and gigs — with trust enforced by escrow and reviews.

### 🛠 Features
- **Listings**:  
  - Users can create listings for services or items (e.g., DJ, drill, tent, tutoring).  
  - Categories kept simple (Tools, Services, Events, Miscellaneous).  

- **Bookings & Escrow**:  
  - Hirer pays into escrow (EcoCash, InnBucks, USD cash-in).  
  - Provider accepts → job marked "In Progress".  
  - On completion → funds released, or refunded if disputed.  

- **Trust Layer**:  
  - Simple KYC-lite: phone/email verification.  
  - Ratings & reviews for each completed hire.  

- **UI/UX**:  
  - Clean Gumroad-style web app (Laravel + Filament).  
  - Landing page with waitlist + early listings.  
  - Mobile-friendly (but no native app).  

- **Admin (Filament)**:  
  - Manage users, listings, disputes, and escrow payouts.  

- **Evidence & Disputes**:  
  - Completion proof: photo upload or confirmation code.  
  - Admin mediates disputes manually.  

### 🚫 Out of Scope (MVP)
- WhatsApp bot  
- Native mobile apps  
- Complex arbitration  
- Automated delivery/logistics  

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- 200+ listings in Mutare  
- 50+ completed hires with escrow  
- NPS ≥ 40 from both hirers & providers
